       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">that the Ukrainian units assigned to lead the offensive had insufficient time to train and prepare.\\n\\nIn July </span>\n",

       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">train.\\n\\nUkrainian personnel also had too little opportunity to train collectively. The number of troops deployed </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">is not the only thing that matters in war: the potency of an army’s manpower is a function of how well small units </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">coordinate, even while dispersed across a broad area. Ukraine’s geography demands especially skilled coordination </span>\n",

       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">pairs of companies under the close management of an understaffed brigade command post. The result was that while </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">Ukrainian soldiers often succeeded in taking enemy positions, they were rarely able to exploit the breaches they </span>\n",

       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">fewer losses, the capabilities of its forces in the field will improve. Diminishing pressure on the frontlines </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">would offer Russia other advantages, too. Moscow would be able to divert experienced troops to train recruits, </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">potentially allowing it to open new offensive axes in the second half of 2024. Russian forces could also </span>\n",

       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">Ukraine. If Ukraine leaves large sections of the front quiet, Russian forces may also be able to significantly </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">expand their fortifications, making any future Ukrainian offensive operations harder to carry out. Even while it </span>\n",

       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">and training can be provided, and when. Over the past two years, Kyiv’s Western allies wasted the time advantages </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">they did have, squandering much of 2022 and 2023 basking in the euphoria of Russia’s early setbacks and imagining </span>\n",
